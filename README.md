- 👋 Hi, I’m @TDALiamo
- 👀 I’m interested in playing Satisfactory and... idk
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... well, not really learning, just messing around. Anyway, I'm trying to make a Satisfactory mod. Probably isn't working. Maybe it is, who knows. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing. There is nothing to collaborate on. 
- 📫 How to reach me - best way is through Discord - TDA_Liamo#7803. Send me a DM or contact me on the modding discord with any issues. Although I doubt that's your concern if you've made it to my Github profile. If you need to speak to me about anything, like I said, just DM me on Discord.
